    <p><i>Machine learning is a <strong>branch</strong> of artificial intelligence</i>that allows computers to learn <br> and improve from data without explicit programming, essentially mimicking human learning by identifying patterns and making predictions based on large datasets; this enables systems to automatically adapt and make better decisions over time, with applications ranging from personalized recommendations on online platforms to medical diagnosis and fraud detection, all by analyzing data and extracting valuable insights. </p>
